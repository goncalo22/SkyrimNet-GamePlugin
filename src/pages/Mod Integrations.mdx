# Mod Integrations

This is where prompts that give Skyrimnet awareness of specific mods, are stored and exposed, for easy sharing and usage.
 They are made using templated logic [decorators](/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/Skyrimnet%20API/decorators) , in that way they can pull specific game data from those mods, in real time, giving immersive context to the characters involved.

{# Internal character knowledge - what they experience and feel #}
{% if bJSW_BB_Trimester3Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is in their third trimester of pregnancy. Their body feels heavy and full, with the baby's movements strong and frequent. They're acutely aware of every kick, shift, and hiccup from within. Sleep is difficult due to the baby's position, and they feel the constant pressure on their bladder and ribs. They know birth is approaching and feel both excitement and apprehension about labor.
{% else if bJSW_BB_Trimester2Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is in their second trimester of pregnancy. The initial nausea has passed, and they feel more energetic and vibrant. They're starting to feel the baby's first gentle movements - flutters and soft nudges that fill them with wonder. Their appetite has returned and they feel a deep connection growing with the life inside them. This is often called the "golden period" of pregnancy for good reason.
{% else if bJSW_BB_Trimester1Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is in their first trimester of pregnancy. Their body is undergoing rapid changes - waves of nausea, extreme fatigue, breast tenderness, and heightened sense of smell. They may feel emotional and overwhelmed by the hormonal shifts. Every day brings new symptoms as their body adapts to supporting new life. They're hyper-aware of every twinge and change.
{% else if bJSW_BB_OvulateEffect or bJSW_SUB_OvulationStamina or bJSW_SUB_OvulationMagicka %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is in their fertile window. They feel a subtle increase in energy and libido, and are instinctively aware their body is at its most receptive for conception. There's a natural vitality and heightened awareness of their reproductive cycle.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PMSEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is experiencing premenstrual syndrome. They feel emotionally sensitive, with mood swings and irritability. Physical symptoms include bloating, breast tenderness, cramping, and general discomfort. They know their period is approaching and feel the familiar constellation of symptoms their body goes through each cycle.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionFertilityEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} feels their fertility magically enhanced. There's an unnatural vitality coursing through their reproductive system, making them acutely aware of their body's increased receptiveness to conception. The magical enhancement creates an almost overwhelming sense of fertility and life force.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionContraceptionEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} can sense their fertility has been magically suppressed. Their natural reproductive cycles feel muted and dampened, as if a magical barrier has been placed around their ability to conceive. The contraceptive magic creates a sense of reproductive dormancy.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionInseminateEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} feels fertility magic actively working within their system to encourage conception. There's a tingling, warm sensation focused on their reproductive organs, and they're aware of magical forces attempting to facilitate pregnancy.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionAbortEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is recovering from ending a pregnancy. They feel physically drained and emotionally raw, processing both the physical effects and the complex emotions surrounding their choice. Their body is readjusting to its non-pregnant state.
{% endif %}

{% else if render_mode == "dialogue_target" %}
{# External observations - what others can see #}
{% if bJSW_BB_Trimester3Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is heavily pregnant with a large, prominent belly. They walk with the characteristic waddle of late pregnancy, one hand often supporting their back. They breathe more heavily and move slowly and carefully. They frequently adjust their position and seem uncomfortable.
{% else if bJSW_BB_Trimester2Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is visibly pregnant with a rounded belly showing beneath their clothing. They have a healthy glow and seem more energetic than someone in early or late pregnancy. They occasionally place protective hands on their midsection.
{% else if bJSW_BB_Trimester1Effect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} shows subtle signs that might suggest early pregnancy to observant individuals - occasional pale moments, careful movements, and a hand pressed to their stomach. However, these signs could easily be attributed to other causes.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PMSEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} seems irritable and slightly uncomfortable. They appear emotionally sensitive and may show signs of physical discomfort - shifting positions frequently or placing a hand on their lower abdomen.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionFertilityEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} radiates unusual vitality and health. There's an almost supernatural glow about them, and they seem particularly vibrant and energetic.
{% else if bJSW_BB_PotionAbortEffect %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} appears physically and emotionally drained. They move carefully and seem pale and tired, as if recovering from a difficult experience.

{# Determine primary cleanliness state using hierarchical logic #}
{% if bDirty_Effect_Clean %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is immaculately clean and well-groomed, with not a speck of dirt or grime to be seen. Their skin glows with health, and their attire has been meticulously maintained.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Dirt1 %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is lightly dusted with dirt on their clothes and skin, the kind that comes from a normal day of travel or work in Skyrim. Nothing unusual or particularly noticeable by local standards.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Dirt2 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt2_Bandits_Fix or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt2_Professional %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is visibly dirty with grime accumulated across their clothing and exposed skin. Their appearance suggests it's been several days since they've had a proper bath or cleaned their garments.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Dirt3 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt3_Professional or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt3_Bandits_Fix %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is heavily soiled with thick layers of dirt and grime covering much of their body and clothing. A noticeable earthy smell emanates from them, and their fingernails are blackened with embedded dirt.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Dirt4 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt4_Bandits_Fix %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is absolutely caked in layers of thick, encrusted filth from head to toe. Their features are barely distinguishable beneath the grime, and they emit a powerful stench of rot, sweat, and decay that causes people nearby to wrinkle their noses in disgust.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Blood1 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Blood1 %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is marked with scattered bloodstains across their garments and skin - spatter marks and small patches that suggest recent violence or perhaps tending to wounds. Though noticeable, the blood is minimal and has begun to dry in places.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Blood2 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Blood2 %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is showing prominent large bloodstains spread across their clothing and armor. Dark crimson patches and streaks suggest they've been in a serious confrontation recently. The metallic scent of blood lingers around them.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Blood3 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Blood3 %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is quite bloody, with gore liberally splashed across their person. Their hands and forearms are particularly stained with half-dried blood, and numerous spatters mark their face and clothing. They look as though they've just walked away from intense combat.
{% else if bDirty_Effect_Blood4 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Blood4 or bDirty_NPCEffect_Blood5 %}
{{ decnpc(actorUUID).name }} is covered in blood to a horrifying degree. They are drenched in crimson from head to toe, with blood soaking their clothing and armor, pooling in crevices, and still glistening wetly in places. Bloody footprints mark their path, and the overwhelming metallic smell of fresh gore surrounds them like an aura.
{% endif %}

{# Add additional descriptors #}
{% if bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt2_Professional or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt3_Professional %}
 The dirt appears related to their profession - the specific pattern of staining and residue suggests the honorable grime of daily work rather than simple neglect.
{% endif %}

{% if bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt2_Bandits_Fix or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt3_Bandits_Fix or bDirty_NPCEffect_Dirt4_Bandits_Fix %}
 They show a distinctive pattern of grime that resembles that of wilderness travelers or those who've recently fought with bandits. There's a particular mixture of forest debris, campfire smoke residue, and weathered stains that could come from extended time in bandit territory or possibly rough living in the wilds.
