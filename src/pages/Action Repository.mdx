# Action Repository

This is where the actions created by the community are exposed, to be shared and used with the Custom Actions SkyrimNet feature.
To use them in your game you just need two simple things, the correct papyrus script and the action yaml file.

 **Download and install the " Skyrimnet_Actions" esp**, provided below. Just activate it as any other mod. It is very lightweight, ony containing the required papyrus scripts for these actions.

You dont need to have all the actions installed, or enabled.You toggle them in list seen in : automation---custom action  , on the web ui.

Additionally you just need to **place each action yaml file in this folder :\SKSE\Plugins\SkyrimNet\config\actions** or **create that folder, in that location, if you dont have it**, the action will appear in the web ui, with **everything preconfigured and ready to use in-game**.
Or install the Yaml zip file as a mod, making the files go automatically to the proper place. 


## Downloads

  </a>
</div>


These two zip files are all that is required to install the complete suite of actions by the author Severause. For now each author will have its own action plugin, that is required to download, if you want their actions. They will be updated as needed to include new additions ( and to prevent users having a growing number of light esp related to these actions).

If you only want certain ones, download the esp and and the correct yaml file, for the specific action, listed below, placing it on the folder described above.
The settings show here, for each action, are exactly what is included in each yaml file.
If you dont have an Actions folder, designing and saving even a non-working one, in the web ui, will auto create such folder.


### Attack Action

This now gives agency to the npcs to lethally attack anyone, if deemed necessary, even you! They will ponder based on context and their own personalities. However,there are other actions, like Threaten and Brawl, intended to 
give more options for npcs to settle offenses, other than a deadly escalation.

 ### Drink Health Potion

 author: Severause

 Skyrimnet already gives vitals context for all npcs , so the gamemaster will often autonomously make them drink a health potion, if needed, with this action. Same for Magikca and Stamina potions.

 Skyrim doesnt come with potion drink animations, as such you can use this mod to enable them: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73819?tab=description
  It has been proven to work well with these actions (and all regular potion drinking ), however take care, your own modlist conflicts or issues is your responsibility!

### Give Gold

This action will create the gold required, promised or asked, even if the npc doesnt have enough. This allows immersive situations like a Jarl always being able to properly reward a player. Abuses can happen, but if you want to cheat you always had the console anyway...

### Give Gold Accounted

author: Severause

This Action only transfers gold within the owned maximum of the character, for maximum immersion and minimal tax evasion. He cant give money he doesnt possess in his inventory
 If having both "give gold" actions , its recommended to disable one of them.

### Start Brawl


Now your bickering, competing followers can duke it out, settling matters. Or you can fully experience the true nord tavern ambience, with some good old fashioned fist-fights. When this action is activated the involved npcs weapons
are hidden from them, while the brawl lasts. The confrontation is entirely non-lethal.
