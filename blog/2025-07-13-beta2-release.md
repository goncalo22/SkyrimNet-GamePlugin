### üöÄ Installation Instructions

Install like any other mod through your mod manager, replacing the existing SkyrimNet files.

#### Important notes when upgrading:
1. The default values for many configurations have changed. We **recommend deleting** the folder:


This will restore all settings to default.
2. New users must still install the models during installation, same as before.

### ‚ú® New Features

- **Item customization interface**  
Users can now customize the display of worn equipment and weapons, as well as enable or disable their visibility.

- **HTTP server address/port config** added.

- **Combat variant selection** in OpenRouter config is now used for dialogue in combat. This allows fast models like Sonnet to be used during combat while retaining slow, high-quality models otherwise.

- **Universal "max volume" setting**  
Applies to both spatial and virtual entity (narrator/player) audio.

- **Memory generation** now uses its own OpenRouter config variant.

- **Sonnet caching support**  
- Significantly reduces costs and response time.  
- Cache TTL is 1 hour (only honored by Anthropic; others use 5 minutes).

- **Dynamic cache-extension**  
Allows the event history cache to span 3√ó longer than normal for better memory fidelity.

- **"The Party" kill attribution toggle** added.

- Characters no longer ship directly in the `prompts` folder. They are now **copied only if missing**, to preserve customizations.

- Settings file also no longer ships in default location. However, **this update will overwrite** it once to enable new format and caching support.

- **VRIK Action hotkey support** added.

### üß† Memory Generation Changes

- Improved memory accuracy for **location and people** involved.
- Avoids generating memories for events within the **last 8 minutes**.
- New default for max memories per retrieval: **5**.
- Memory generation algorithm is now **time-segmented**:

#### Segmentation Rules:
1. Segment must last at least **10 game minutes** (`min_segment_duration`)
2. Segment max is **12 game hours** (`max_segment_duration`)
3. Max **200 events** per memory
4. Minimum **5 events**
5. Time gap of over 60 minutes triggers a boundary

#### Examples:
- **Conversation ‚Üí Travel ‚Üí Combat**


> In testing:  
> **518 ‚Üí 162** memories  
> Nearly same fidelity, significantly more cohesive.

#### To regenerate old memories:
1. Set `"Event Preload Count"` to `5000` in config
2. Delete all memories via in-game UI
3. Restart game
4. Click "Generate" in memory tab (up to 100 each batch)
5. Repeat as needed or increase batch size in config
