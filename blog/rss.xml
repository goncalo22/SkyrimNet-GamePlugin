            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🎉  SkyrimNet Beta 9 Latest</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-features">New Features<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/22/%20beta9-release#new-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Features" title="Direct link to New Features">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>OmniSight System</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Omnisight is a new image-to-text system providing enhanced environmental awareness by capturing screenshots and submitting them to the LLM for evaluation during player-initiated dialogue and when entering new areas. A new OmniSight page in the UI displays all captured images and descriptions, and a card on the dashboard shows the latest screenshot with description. On default settings this system will passively, substantially improve LLM awareness of your surroundings without active player engagement. The AI will now "See what is happening in the world around you".</li>
<li>Added a hotkey to capture and describe the current target in your crosshair (hold to describe your own character). When an actor has been captured, visual descriptions replace appearance text from actor bios.</li>
<li>At default settings, each capture costs less than $0.0004 with multiple configuration options available to control behavior and reduce costs as needed.</li>
<li>This system is properly aware of first person versus third person camera perspective, and will attempt to avoid fixating on the player character when in third person view.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trace Explorer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Traces are a way to understand what's happening during AI response generation and troubleshoot latency issues. Each request flows through multiple systems with a lot happening in parallel - memory retrieval, context building, LLM calls, post-processing, audio generation, audio playback - and traces let you see exactly where time is being spent.</li>
<li>The Trace Explorer displays this information in time span and waterfall views with detailed metadata for each operation, making it easy to identify bottlenecks or understand why a particular response took longer than expected.</li>
<li>Currently instruments player-initiated flows (player to NPC, player to self, etc.), with expanded coverage planned for future updates. Traces can be exported and shared for debugging.</li>
<li>Building this feature led to discovery and resolution of several performance bottlenecks, improving response speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49ef476-2ca5-48e1-9e32-51f1f6383808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49ef476-2ca5-48e1-9e32-51f1f6383808</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74da7678-afff-47a5-bb4c-7d1aec44eba0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74da7678-afff-47a5-bb4c-7d1aec44eba0</a></p>
<p><strong>MCP Server Integration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Live game data is now exposed through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, running on port 8889 by default. MCP is a standardized way for AI applications to access external data sources - in this case, allowing AI assistants in code editors (like Claude in Cursor) to read your loaded mod data, active quests, and other game state information.</li>
<li>This is leveraged by the agentic prompt editor (see below) to automatically build powerful integrations with your installed mods. Additional tools will be added in future updates.</li>
<li>If you want to use this with an external editor (normal users can ignore this), add this to your MCP configuration file:</li>
</ul>
<div class="language-json codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-json codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"mcpServers"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"skyrimnet"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">      </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"url"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"http://localhost:8889/sse"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Additional tools will be added in future updates, and I have quite a bit planned that will leverage this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>AI Prompt Agent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new AI assistant in the prompt editor helps you write and modify prompts. It can read loaded game/mod data through the MCP server to help build custom integrations with your installed mods.</li>
<li>The agent is aware of our Inja template syntax and will self-correct if it produces syntactically invalid output. This significantly streamlines the process of integrating new mods, though it does not 100% automate the process - it goes a long way towards easing it. I'll probably add similar agents to help with trigger and action creation in the future as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example - Updating an existing prompt:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56a9a065-6ee5-41a5-b813-6e908177c011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56a9a065-6ee5-41a5-b813-6e908177c011</a></p>
<p>Example - Building a new integration for Survival Mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d050078f-3067-4b92-a628-f016fd9a7b3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d050078f-3067-4b92-a628-f016fd9a7b3c</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe615f12-cd6c-4cfb-bbbf-6b33deade6f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe615f12-cd6c-4cfb-bbbf-6b33deade6f8</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/935be2cd-60b3-4e7f-93ec-76c3025fe1ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/935be2cd-60b3-4e7f-93ec-76c3025fe1ea</a></p>
<p><strong>In-game Hotkey Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MCM-based hotkey configuration is now available, primarily intended for VR and gamepad players. Includes native support for VR controllers, bringing VR support for SkyrimNet up to parity with flatrim keyboard support.</li>
<li>Enable this in the MCM to use it instead of the DLL hotkey system (use one or the other, not both). The DLL-based native hotkeys are slightly faster as they don't go through Papyrus, but these are otherwise functionally equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763dc4a2-c55b-46fd-9e71-5407d91b15af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763dc4a2-c55b-46fd-9e71-5407d91b15af</a></p>
<p><strong>Whitelist/Blacklist Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added wheel menu options to easily add or remove actors from whitelist/blacklist factions directly during gameplay, making it much faster to manage actor permissions on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tweaks">Tweaks<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/22/%20beta9-release#tweaks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tweaks" title="Direct link to Tweaks">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Prompt Engine Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The prompt engine has been hardened to handle malformed input (like missing functions/variables) more gracefully, now logging warnings instead of failing the entire template render with errors. Fixed prompt validation in the UI to eliminate false positives by actually using the template engine to parse templates instead of a linter-based approach.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>{% raw %}{% endraw %}</code> blocks for escaping content, <code>elif</code> statements, and <code>{{ variable | function }}</code> notation (Jinja-style). Added common array manipulation functions for easier prompt construction and improved whitespace handling for better readability.</li>
<li>Hash symbol (#) is no longer a reserved character in prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prompt Quality Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly reworked main dialogue and roleplay prompts based on community feedback and testing. These changes should result in more natural AI behavior with reduced fixation on specific patterns introduced in earlier versions.</li>
<li>Player thoughts and dialogue generation prompts received similar quality improvements. All prompts have been updated to utilize new whitespace rules for better readability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skyrim Quest Tracking Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored the internal quest tracking system for better efficiency. Quest objectives and their completion status are now exposed to template decorators for use in prompts.</li>
<li>Added an improved active quest filter to the player thoughts prompt by default, allowing the AI to be aware of your active quests as context without over-fixating on them. I'll play around with conditionally exposing them in other prompts beyond player thoughts in future updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">{% for quest in get_all_active_quests() %}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">{% for objective in quest.objectives %}{{ quest.name }}: {{ objective.objectiveText }}{% if objective.isCompleted %} (Completed){% endif %}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">{% endfor %}{% endfor %}</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Becomes</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Imperial Introductions: Join the Imperial Legion</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Before the Storm: Talk to Alvor in Riverwood</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Unbound: Escape Helgen (Completed)</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Performance &amp; Memory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Memory search query generation is now non-blocking, improving response times significantly in situations where the query was not already cached. Fixed hybrid memory retrieval to properly use player's last input for thought/transform inputs, which should improve the relevancy of memory recall from the vector database.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DBVO &amp; Audio</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed "DBVO - Silent NPC TTS" config setting to off by default. Existing players who are not using DBVO should disable this in their game configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Template &amp; Scripting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>has_magic_archetype</code> decorator for checking if an actor has an entire archetype of magic effects. This allows you to easily check for things like "Calm", "Frenzy", "Reanimation", etc. without having to hardcode checks for every individual magic effect that falls under those categories.</li>
<li>Added array manipulation functions for easier prompt construction: append, push, insert, pop, remove, clear, reverse, index, count, flatten, keys, values, items, get, has_key. Also added <code>JoinStrings</code> utility function for in-template string manipulation.</li>
<li>Migrated variables to use consistent camelCase naming convention moving forward. @vrelk</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spells containing "SkyrimNet" in their name are now filtered from recent events to reduce clutter.</li>
<li>Added configuration option to allow summoned/reanimated creatures to bypass the actor filter.</li>
<li>Reduced the verbosity of logging output - more improvements to this planned for future releases.</li>
<li>Added mouse button support for keybinds in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/22/%20beta9-release#bug-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bug Fixes" title="Direct link to Bug Fixes">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Local LLM Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added configuration option to disable SSE (Server-Sent Events) to fix support for local LLM users. This was broken in Beta 7 or Beta 8 when we added proper SSE protocol support for OpenAI-compatible endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DBVO &amp; Voice Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash that occurred when rapidly switching between open mic and voice record functions. Fixed hard crash when using DBVO with Conquest of Skyrim and potentially other mods.</li>
<li>Fixed dialogue options not appearing when using Silent NPC TTS mode. Added missing TTS audio for goodbye lines with Silent NPC TTS enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed players and NPCs sometimes speaking with the wrong voice when using DBVO with Zonos mod. Stopped DBVO subtitles from being split into segments, which was causing the subtitles to flicker frequently.</li>
<li>Changed "voicetype is nullptr" log message from error level to warning level, as it can occur in some situations that are not actually problematic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Character &amp; Actor Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added mannequins (MannequinRace) to the default blacklists to prevent them from speaking and having memories. Fixed issue where changes to actor bio templates would not reflect properly until restart. Fixed dynamic bio template not being available until restart if some of the subcomponents were edited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dialogue &amp; Memory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resolved UTF-8 encoding issues with diary entries. Fixed several issues that were causing NPC-to-NPC dialogue to be unreliable in generating responses and misattributing the target to the player instead of the actual NPC being addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engine &amp; Stability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed UTF-8 encoding errors when visiting certain locations in Maelstrom mod</li>
<li>Fixed crash that would occur when enabling Kokoro TTS without having its dependencies properly installed.</li>
<li>Fixed potential access violation in the audio engine.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where mood evaluation requests were ignoring the majority of meta configuration options.</li>
<li>Resolved several error handling issues in the template engine introduced by the graceful error handling changes.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues that were causing npc -&gt; npc dialogue to be unreliable in generating responses, and misattribute target to the player.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assorted Tweaks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Book references in the event history now show only the book title instead of dumping the entire book text, significantly improving performance and token usage.</li>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backwards-incompatible-prompt-restructuring---min">Backwards Incompatible Prompt Restructuring   @Min<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release#backwards-incompatible-prompt-restructuring---min" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backwards Incompatible Prompt Restructuring   @Min" title="Direct link to Backwards Incompatible Prompt Restructuring   @Min">​</a></h3>
<p>The coherency of our system prompt has been mediocre, and has been getting worse as more and more community plugins are developed. In order to improve the quality of LLM roleplay, I have done a one-time backwards incompatible restructuring of our system prompt and character bio.</p>
<p>Every mod-added addition to the bio, or system head should number itself accordingly so that the file ends up in the appropriate place in the prompt for consistency. For example, ### Worn Equipment is now nested under ## Appearance &amp; Physical State. I've updated @wind and @Lazy Palm 's mods to follow this convention, though all mod authors are likely to need to rename their files to account for this if they have additions to the character bio or system head sections, in order to ensure that their information is placed at the right spot. Check out the character_bio and system_head folders to reference the new structure.</p>
<p>This will result in stronger and more consistent LLM responses, particularly from non-premium models (Though Sonnet and others benefit as well), and provides a solid base for us to build upon moving forward.  Almost every prompt has been touched in the character_bio and system_head submodules</p>
<p>Definitely open to suggestions and feedback on the new system prompt structure. Let me know what folks think.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overhauled-uuid-algorithm----min">Overhauled UUID algorithm.    @Min<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release#overhauled-uuid-algorithm----min" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overhauled UUID algorithm.    @Min" title="Direct link to Overhauled UUID algorithm.    @Min">​</a></h3>
<p>There were several sources of drift with the old algorithm that could cause duplicate and/or drifting uuid's.,</p>
<p>I've written a diagnostic feature to detect this problem / migrate the entire database to the new uuid algorithm so that people don't lose events/memories (Like many of you, I also don't like restarting constantly if I can help it  ).,</p>
<p>This should correct cases where actors lost access to their memories and past events. There were a few reasons why this could happen, including adding/removing mods, changing load order, and other factors.,</p>
<p>There is still a remaining source of drift for non-generic actors; Their ref id mutates regularly throughout normal play. I haven't addressed this just yet entirely, and am not sure if I need to or not as of yet. If I do need to address this, you'll be able to use this same tool to migrate to whatever I end up changing without losing data/progress.,</p>
<p>Consider backing up your database before proceeding if you want to be able to revert back to rc6. The database can be found in skse/plugins/SkyrimNet/data/,
To migrate your database to the new schemas, first:,</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-feature-diaries-min">New Feature: Diaries @Min<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release#new-feature-diaries-min" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Feature: Diaries @Min" title="Direct link to New Feature: Diaries @Min">​</a></h3>
<p>Added UI and experience around generating, viewing, and managing Diary Entries. Diary entries are currently triggered manually, just like dynamic bio updates,</p>
<p>Diary entries are generated based upon recent memories, and recent events.,</p>
<p>Added new model type for this, so that you can use a separate model for diaries. Note: The default for this is Sonnet. If you're cost-adverse, I'd suggest changing this to qwen or deepseek r1.,</p>
<p>Diaries contain their own event type with a proper schema; You can create triggers/etc off of them like anything else. This event is persistent, and exposed only to the actor that made the diary.,</p>
<p>Diary entries create an entry into the memory database with embeddings, so that they can be recalled by the actor later like any other memory.,</p>
<p>New Diary specific configuration: Check out the available options.,</p>
<p>I tested this feature a fair bit, but there may be some rough edges: Send any feedback you may have around this! New diaries for actors that did not previously have one can (currently) only be generated from the Character page or the dashboard.,</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-feature-open-mic-input-mode-daikichi">New Feature: Open Mic input mode @Daikichi<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release#new-feature-open-mic-input-mode-daikichi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Feature: Open Mic input mode @Daikichi" title="Direct link to New Feature: Open Mic input mode @Daikichi">​</a></h3>
<p>Adds a toggle hotkey (default unset) to use voice activated input as an alternative to push-to-talk.,</p>
<p>Also changed the default Silence Duration in STTConfig from 500ms to 1000ms (the period of silence required after you speak for the speech to be finalized).,</p>
<p>Added Open Mic VRIK functions as well.,</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-feature-allow-tts-engine-and-tts-language-overrides-daikichi">New Feature: Allow TTS Engine and TTS Language Overrides @Daikichi,<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release#new-feature-allow-tts-engine-and-tts-language-overrides-daikichi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Feature: Allow TTS Engine and TTS Language Overrides @Daikichi," title="Direct link to New Feature: Allow TTS Engine and TTS Language Overrides @Daikichi,">​</a></h3>

<p>Adds a feature to voice silent NPC lines with TTS (from mods with no voice acting).,</p>
<p>To enable this feature, download Dragonborn Voice Over but disable or delete its DBVO.esp file (no voice pack is needed).,</p>
<p>Lip sync/subtitles and the spoken dialogue may not match up perfectly, though we make our best effort.,</p>
<p>Added a config option to aggressively sync displayed subtitles with the TTS audio. Disabled by default due to some potential UX friction. @Daikichi,</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/10/12/beta6-release#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h3>
<p>This release is mostly focused on bugfixes, quality of life improvements, and several cool new features such as model rotation, automatic voiced player vanilla dialogue through DBVO, XTTS voice cloning, and a new whisper mode.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="xtts-voice-cloning-elbios">XTTS Voice cloning @Elbios<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/10/12/beta6-release#xtts-voice-cloning-elbios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to XTTS Voice cloning @Elbios" title="Direct link to XTTS Voice cloning @Elbios">​</a></h3>
<p>Now XTTS has automatic voice cloning just like Zonos or our other Gradios TTS with the same mechanism.
When running XTTS locally, requires updated xtts-api-server available here
When using vast AI, no action is needed
Comes with an option to turn automatic voice cloning off.
Model Rotation @mikastamm
New model rotation feature, that changes the dialogue model after each generation.</p>
<p>In the model name field, you can now have multiple models, seperated by commas. After each converation turn, it will switch models to the next in the list. This only works for the ‘Default’ (Conversation) model type</p>
<p>This can make the NPCs responses more varied or keep weaker models on-track by having a smarter model respond every once in a while.</p>
<p>Try mixing in a stronger model once in a while to keep the conversation interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">"openrouter/sonoma-dusk-alpha, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
<li>Add two missing actions to VRIK @mikastamm</li>
<li>Add a simple List Menu to change some commonly toggled configs from in-game (Still needs a spell to open it, but it works) @mikastamm</li>
<li>Added a new is_player decorator for prompt usage. Example: is_player(npc.UUID). This will return true if the actor is the player. @MinLL</li>

<p>SkyrimNet now supports voicing the player's vanilla dialogue lines with TTS.
To enable this feature, download Dragonborn Voice Over but disable or delete its DBVO.esp file (no voice pack is needed).
SkyrimNet will capture the dialogue event from DBVO and send it to TTS, rather than using a static voice pack.
You can adjust the delay before an NPC responds to your dialogue selection in Advanced Configuration -&gt; game -&gt; Player-Voiced Vanilla Dialogue (DBVO).
If the DBVO.esp file is active, then this feature will be disabled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players can now toggle between two configureable "max interaction ranges".
This setting limits the range at which actors will perceive events. You can configure the radius via the game config.
Useful if you want to have a more private conversation without nosy folks interrupting.
More coming in this particular area soon.</li>

<li>Actor skills are now exposed in the return value from decnpc in templates. Ex. decnpc(npc.UUID).onehanded @MinLL</li>
<li>Added memory generation filter, allowing you to control which actor's generate memories.</li>
<li>Newly registered event schemas are now enabled by default @MinLL</li>
<li>Added new SkyrimNet factions to actor filter by default. No flow is published at present for easily adding/removing things to these outside of the console, but this will let us later set up a flow to allow users to - easily allowlist/denylist NPC's. @vrelk</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🎉  SkyrimNet Beta 5 Latest</p>
<p><strong>Beta 5</strong> represents a major leap forward in mod integration capabilities, with ~90% of integrations now possible <em>without writing code</em> through three core systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> – Expose any Papyrus function as an LLM action.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong> – Create conditional AI reactions to game events.</li>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong> – Improved decorators give the LLM real-time access to game state and mod data.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also delivers:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Now supports per-actor customizations (And per-group). Groups are sets of config overrides that you can apply to multiple actors (Ex, "High quality" for followers, etc) to avoid having to maintain the same settings in more than one place. I'll likely expand the "group" feature to allow automatic application to factions, races, genders, etc at a later point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The config system itself supports overriding any config value from any config file anywhere (Assuming that the config value makes sense within a per-actor context), but I need to explicitly enable support the field being overridable like this. Let me know what areas you folks think would benefit the most from being wired up. In the initial implementation, I support overriding the voice id, and openrouter settings, as those seem to be the two highest ROI. It's relatively easy to add more from here, though supporting multiple different TTS engines simultaneously is not currently possible. I'll fix this at a later point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-feature">New Feature:<a href="https://goncalo22.github.io/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/21/beta4-release#new-feature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Feature:" title="Direct link to New Feature:">​</a></h3>
<p>Added a dictionary for changing the pronunciation of words pronounced by the TTS (Khajiit -&gt; Kajeet, etc). If you notice any words that are consistently being misread by TTS and you think it should be part of the default dictionary, let us know in #beta-feedback!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elbios' vastAI images are the new default images for smart create. These images are improvements over the existing ones which feature the ability to run both Whisper and (XTTS or Zonos) out of the same image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for sending keep-alive messages to prevent the new images from tearing themselves down. Elbios' images are configured to automatically shut down after one hour of inactivity to prevent users from forgetting about them and running up a bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanded smart create logic for VastAI - It will now create N instances (default: 5), and then tear down all but the first one to successfully come up and be ready to serve traffic. This should result in much more reliable instance creation, and result in the user ending up with better/faster images more often than before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new presets for VastAI creation - Can now switch between XTTS and Zonos image presets in the VastAI page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added button for quick-setting STT (External Whisper) to the VastAI instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed prompt issue causing actors to fixate on their weapon (Hand goes to dagger narrate spam).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line of Sight requirement for events is now ignored during combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assorted prompt tweaks and fixes.</p>
