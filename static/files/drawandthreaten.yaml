name: DrawAndThreaten
description: "Use when: tension escalates in dialogue and a warning stance is appropriate, not a real attack. \nDo not be afraid to use it liberally when the speaker says they are putting their hand on their sword hilt or if a grievous insult is hurled at you. If a narration claims that the speaker has drawn their weapon, use this function as well"
