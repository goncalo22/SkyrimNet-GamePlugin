# üöÄ Getting Started

SkyrimNet is easy to set up and flexible to use, whether you're running it locally or leveraging cloud services.

---

## üì¶ Installation

Download the latest release from:  
üëâ [SkyrimNet Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases)

You‚Äôll see **two versions** ‚Äî choose **one** based on your system:

- **üéÆ CUDA Build**  
  Use this if you have an **NVIDIA graphics card**.  
  Includes Whisper STT locally and improves performance of some components.

- **üß© Universal Build**  
  Use this if you **don‚Äôt have an NVIDIA GPU**, or plan to use Whisper remotely via **Vast.ai**, **OpenAI**, or **text input only**.

> üì• Install the downloaded `.zip` as a **mod** via your mod manager (e.g., MO2 or Vortex).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

You **must install** all dependencies listed in:  
üîó [System Requirements](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin?tab=readme-ov-file#-system-requirements)

- For **CUDA users**, make sure to install the **CUDA Toolkit** and **restart your PC** after installing ‚Äî this is crucial.
