</p>


**Vast.ai** is a marketplace for renting GPU computing power at low cost from providers around the world. It's widely used for AI, machine learning, 3D rendering, and other compute-heavy tasks — including real-time voice synthesis and LLM inference.

---

## 🌍 What Is It?

Vast.ai isn't a traditional cloud provider. Instead, it’s a **decentralized marketplace** where:
- Individuals and companies rent out their idle GPUs
- Users (like you) can choose hardware based on price, performance, and location

You get **root access** to a full Linux instance with the GPU of your choice — often much cheaper than AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

## ⚡ Key Features

- ✅ **Cheap GPU Access** – Pay-as-you-go, starting as low as ~$0.10/hour
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering** – Filter by GPU type (A100, 4090, etc.), RAM, disk, bandwidth
- 🚀 **Fast Launch** – Deploy instances in under 60 seconds
- 📡 **Port Forwarding** – Easily expose ports to access web UIs or APIs
- 🔧 **Custom Images** – Run any Docker container, or upload your own setup
- 🧠 **AI-Ready** – Prebuilt images for PyTorch, TensorFlow, Whisper, XTTS, etc.
