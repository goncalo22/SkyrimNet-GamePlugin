#  Player Dialogue & Thoughts

<p align="center">
  <img src="/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/img/dialogue.png" alt="dialogue" width="500"/>
</p>

This system allows the player to express **internal thoughts**, **spoken reactions**, and **context-aware dialogue** in response to game events, driven by LLM prompts. It blends narrative depth with character voice, enabling SkyrimNet to act like a true interactive roleplay engine. This system, depending on user settings and preferences turns your character into a blend of someone you control but that can also display a degree of creative and autonomous responses, inside the decisions you make and the personality you set.

---

## ✅ Core Concepts

### 1. **Player Dialogue**
- Direct dialogue spoken by the player character. (either by text input or using speech-to-text, like open ai.whisper)
- Can be manually initiated or generated in response to gameplay events.
- Often injected into conversation trees or scene interactions.

### 2. **Player Thoughts**
- Internal monologue generated by the LLM.
- Not voiced aloud (unless overridden); shown as *thoughts* in logs or text.
- Driven by the `"thought"` response type in config.
- Uses the **`Player Thoughts`** virtual entity (voice, location, behavior can be customized).

### 3. **Player Reactions**
- Autonomous responses to gameplay events.
- Can be either:
  - `thought` (internal)
  - `audible` (spoken)
- Triggered by configurable event types like `combat`, `book_read`, or `death`.

you can add additional already registered events to the default listing, by using the **add entry** button. Enabling them, allowing automatic reactions, setting the reaction as a thought or audible speech and choosing a specific cooldown for them.



## ⚙️ Configuration Overview

### 🔩 **System Enabled**
- Global toggle for all autonomous player thoughts and reactions.
- If disabled, no reactive thoughts or internal monologues will be generated.

### 🧩 **Autonomous Response Events**

Each event includes:

| Field         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Event Type`  | What triggers the reaction (e.g., `book_read`, `combat`, `crime`) |
| `Enabled`     | Whether the response is active |
| `Response Type` | `thought` (internal) or `audible` (spoken aloud) |
| `Probability` | Chance (0.0 to 1.0) that a reaction will occur |
| `Cooldown`    | Minimum time between this event type’s responses |

### ✅ Example Settings:

| Event       | Response Type | Probability | Cooldown (s) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `book_read` | `thought`      | 1.0         | 300          |
| `combat`    | `thought`      | 0.8         | 120          |
| `crime`     | `thought`      | 0.6         | 90           |
| `death`     | `audible`      | 1.0         | 300          |
| `dragon_soul`| `thought`     | 1.0         | 30           |
| `hit`       | `audible`      | 0.1         | 90           |

## 🎭 Virtual Entities

Used to distinguish **voices**, **locations**, and **narrative context** for different types of AI-driven outputs.

| Entity Name       | Voice ID            | Location           | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|
| `Game Master`     | `malecommoner`      | `Meta Space`       | World controller, narrative injection |
| `Narrator`        | `dlc1seranavoice`   | `Omniscient Space` | Descriptive narration or transitions |
| `Player Thoughts` | `playervoicefemale01` | `Player's Mind`    | Internal monologue of the player |
| `System Voice`    | `femaleeventoned`   | `System Space`     | Optional meta/system messages |

### 🧠 How It Works (Internally)

1. **Event fires** (e.g., player enters combat)
2. System checks:
   - Is **Player Dialogue & Thoughts** enabled?
   - Is this **event type** enabled in the config?
   - Has the **cooldown expired**?
   - Does it pass the **probability check**?
3. If all checks pass:
   - Chooses the appropriate **prompt type** (`thought` or `audible`)
   - Invokes the **LLM** to generate the response
   - Logs or outputs the result using the assigned **virtual entity** (voice, location, etc.)

---

### 🧠 Use Cases

- Let players **comment on the world** naturally  
  > *"This book is about... interesting."*

- Enable **emotional roleplay** after major events  
  > *"Another soul claimed by my blade..."*

- Create **reactive immersion** through fear, anger, reflection, or awe

- Tie into **virtual entities** like *Game Master*, *Narrator*, and *System* for layered storytelling

---

###  ✅ Tips for Customization

- Use **lower cooldowns** and **high probabilities** for frequent inner thoughts (e.g., when exploring ruins)
- **Mix audible and internal reactions** for a rich, immersive experience
- Customize the **Player Thoughts** virtual entity to match your character’s voice and personality
- **Combine with GameMaster, Narrator, and System entities** to produce deeply layered narrative moments


## 🕯 Whisper Mode — Privacy Bubble System

**Overview**  
Whisper Mode is a dynamic interaction system that limits how far NPCs can perceive or respond to player actions, speech, and events. When activated, it creates a *privacy bubble* around the player, reducing detection, dialogue triggers, and AI event propagation beyond a defined range. This allows private or stealthy interactions without unwanted NPC interruptions.

**Core Behavior**  
- **Event Isolation:** All AI perception, dialogue, and trigger events are ignored by NPCs outside the configured interaction range.  
- **Dynamic Range Control:** The system adjusts interaction distances in real time based on the player’s mode (Normal or Whisper).  
- **Hotkey Toggle:** Players can seamlessly switch modes using a designated hotkey.  
- **Immersive Privacy:** Enables confidential conversations, secret actions, or stealth gameplay without global AI awareness.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/img/whisper2.png" alt="dialogue" width="1200"/>
</p>

**Default Configuration Example**  
- Max Interaction Distance: 1200 (global upper limit for NPC detection and interaction)  
- Normal Max Interaction Distance: 1200 (default range for normal dialogue and detection)  
- Whisper Max Interaction Distance: 200 (reduced range while whispering, isolating nearby events)  
- Max Audible Distance: 2400 (maximum range before speech becomes inaudible, in the tts sound generation, unrelated to the perception of events itself, this just simulates sound decay)

**Effect**  
While Whisper Mode is active, no events, speech, or triggers generated by the player are perceived beyond the *Whisper Max Interaction Distance*. NPCs outside this radius remain unaware of the player’s actions or voice until the mode is disabled or the player moves closer.




# 🗣️ Dragonborn Voice Over (DBVO)

**Dragonborn Voice Over (DBVO)** is a **Skyrim SE/AE mod** that makes the **player character fully voiced** — using **text-to-speech (TTS)** or pre-recorded voice packs — for all vanilla and mod-added dialogue.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

By default, the player in Skyrim is silent — dialogue options appear only as text.  
**DBVO** changes that by giving the **player a voice** that actually *speaks* those dialogue lines aloud, similar to NPCs.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Detects when the **player selects a dialogue line**.  
- Uses a **prebuilt voice pack** to generate and play the voice audio.  
- Works for both **vanilla** and **modded dialogue**.  
- Integrates with mods like **Fuz Ro D-oh** and **SKSE** for handling subtitles and script events.

---



---

## 🔄 SkyrimNet Integration

SkyrimNet integrates with DBVO to provide **dynamic player voicing** using its own TTS system.

- SkyrimNet **hooks into DBVO’s dialogue events** instead of using static voice packs.  
- All **TTS generation and playback** is handled by SkyrimNet’s engine (Zonos, XTTS, or other providers).  
- This ensures consistent tone, personality, and emotional variation across dialogue.

### **Setup with SkyrimNet**

1. Install **Dragonborn Voice Over**.  
2. **Disable or delete `DBVO.esp`** — no voice pack is needed.  
3. SkyrimNet will automatically **capture DBVO dialogue events** and send them to TTS.  
4. You can configure response delay under:  
   `Advanced Configuration → game → Player-Voiced Vanilla Dialogue (DBVO)`  

> ⚠️ **Note:** If `DBVO.esp` is active, SkyrimNet will automatically **disable this feature** to prevent conflicts with DBVO’s own voice system.
