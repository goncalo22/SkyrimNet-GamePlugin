#  Player Dialogue & Thoughts

<p align="center">
  <img src="/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/img/dialogue.png" alt="dialogue" width="500"/>
</p>

This system allows the player to express **internal thoughts**, **spoken reactions**, and **context-aware dialogue** in response to game events, driven by LLM prompts. It blends narrative depth with character voice, enabling SkyrimNet to act like a true interactive roleplay engine.

---

## ✅ Core Concepts

### 1. **Player Dialogue**
- Direct dialogue spoken by the player character.
- Can be manually initiated or generated in response to gameplay events.
- Often injected into conversation trees or scene interactions.

### 2. **Player Thoughts**
- Internal monologue generated by the LLM.
- Not voiced aloud (unless overridden); shown as *thoughts* in logs or text.
- Driven by the `"thought"` response type in config.
- Uses the **`Player Thoughts`** virtual entity (voice, location, behavior can be customized).

### 3. **Player Reactions**
- Autonomous responses to gameplay events.
- Can be either:
  - `thought` (internal)
  - `audible` (spoken)
- Triggered by configurable event types like `combat`, `book_read`, or `death`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Overview

### 🔩 **System Enabled**
- Global toggle for all autonomous player thoughts and reactions.
- If disabled, no reactive thoughts or internal monologues will be generated.

### 🧩 **Autonomous Response Events**

Each event includes:

| Field         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Event Type`  | What triggers the reaction (e.g., `book_read`, `combat`, `crime`) |
| `Enabled`     | Whether the response is active |
| `Response Type` | `thought` (internal) or `audible` (spoken aloud) |
| `Probability` | Chance (0.0 to 1.0) that a reaction will occur |
| `Cooldown`    | Minimum time between this event type’s responses |

### ✅ Example Settings:

| Event       | Response Type | Probability | Cooldown (s) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `book_read` | `thought`      | 1.0         | 300          |
| `combat`    | `thought`      | 0.8         | 120          |
| `crime`     | `thought`      | 0.6         | 90           |
| `death`     | `audible`      | 1.0         | 300          |
| `dragon_soul`| `thought`     | 1.0         | 30           |
| `hit`       | `audible`      | 0.1         | 90           |

## 🎭 Virtual Entities

Used to distinguish **voices**, **locations**, and **narrative context** for different types of AI-driven outputs.

| Entity Name       | Voice ID            | Location           | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|
| `Game Master`     | `malecommoner`      | `Meta Space`       | World controller, narrative injection |
| `Narrator`        | `dlc1seranavoice`   | `Omniscient Space` | Descriptive narration or transitions |
| `Player Thoughts` | `playervoicefemale01` | `Player's Mind`    | Internal monologue of the player |
| `System Voice`    | `femaleeventoned`   | `System Space`     | Optional meta/system messages |

## 💬 Prompt Types Involved

### 1. **Player Thoughts Prompt**

Example Template:
```jinja
[Internal Monologue]
{{ actor_name }} has just experienced: {{ recent_event }}.
Context:
{{ recent_context }}

What does {{ actor_name }} think?

```

## 🧠 Prompt Handling Details

### 1. **Player Thought Prompt**
- Only used when `response_type = thought`
- Injected silently unless voice output is configured

---

### 2. **Player Audible Reaction Prompt**

#### Example Template:
```jinja
[Spoken Player Reaction]
Situation: {{ triggering_event }}
Location: {{ actor_location }}
Mood: {{ current_emotion }}

Generate a natural verbal response.

```
### 🗣️ Audible Reactions

- Used when `response_type = audible`
- Spoken aloud using the **Player voice** or **TTS configuration**

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Internally)

1. **Event fires** (e.g., player enters combat)
2. System checks:
   - Is **Player Dialogue & Thoughts** enabled?
   - Is this **event type** enabled in the config?
   - Has the **cooldown expired**?
   - Does it pass the **probability check**?
3. If all checks pass:
   - Chooses the appropriate **prompt type** (`thought` or `audible`)
   - Invokes the **LLM** to generate the response
   - Logs or outputs the result using the assigned **virtual entity** (voice, location, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Let players **comment on the world** naturally  
  > *"This book is about... interesting."*

- Enable **emotional roleplay** after major events  
  > *"Another soul claimed by my blade..."*

- Create **reactive immersion** through fear, anger, reflection, or awe

- Tie into **virtual entities** like *Game Master*, *Narrator*, and *System* for layered storytelling

---

## ✅ Tips for Customization

- Use **lower cooldowns** and **high probabilities** for frequent inner thoughts (e.g., when exploring ruins)
- **Mix audible and internal reactions** for a rich, immersive experience
- Customize the **Player Thoughts** virtual entity to match your character’s voice and personality
- **Combine with GameMaster, Narrator, and System entities** to produce deeply layered narrative moments
