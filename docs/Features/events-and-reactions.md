#  Event & Reaction System 

SkyrimNet’s event system enables **dynamic memory**, **LLM-based dialogue**, and **NPC reactivity** by processing structured in-game events. These events act as the core data stream that drives memory formation, conversation context, and AI behavior.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. Events
- **Definition:** Structured records representing player or NPC actions (e.g., combat, dialogue, spell casting).
- **Per Event Type Settings:**
  - `Enabled`: If unchecked, event is ignored.
  - `Persistent`: If checked, event is logged to the memory database.
  - `Allow NPC Reaction`: Enables live NPC responses.
  - `NPC Reaction Cooldown`: Time in seconds before another reaction to the same type.

### 2. Dialogue Context History
- **Setting:** `Event History Count – Dialogue`
- **Default:** 50 (range: 5–200)
- **Purpose:** Controls how many past events are passed to the LLM during dialogue generation.

### 3. Preloaded Event Memory
- **Setting:** `Event Preload Count` (e.g., 1000)
- **Range:** 500–8000
- **Purpose:** Number of past events preloaded on game start to prime memory and context.

## 🧠 How Events Influence Memory & Dialogue

| Feature                    | Uses Events | Needs Persistence | Affected by Cooldowns |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| LLM Dialogue Context       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                  |
| Memory Recall / Reflection | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                  |
| NPC Live Reactions         | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                 |
| Event Logging / Debugging  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                  |

> ✅ Best practice: Events you want remembered or reacted to should be `Enabled`, `Persistent`, and have `Allow NPC Reaction` set appropriately.

## 💬 NPC Reactions Overview

- **What They Are:** Real-time dialogue or behavior responses triggered by in-game events.
- **Cooldowns:**
  - **Global Cooldown:** Minimum delay between *any* reactions (e.g., 60s).
  - **Per-Event Cooldown:** Delay between reacting to the *same* event type (e.g., 180s for combat).

### Example Use Cases:
- NPC comments on spell casting (`spell_cast`)
- NPC notices player looting a container (`container_changed`)
- NPC reacts to combat or death (`combat`, `death`)

## 🧪 Event Type Tiers – Recommendation Matrix

| Event Type             | Enable | Persist | NPC React | Cooldown |
|------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| `combat`, `death`      | ✅     | ✅      | ✅        | 120–180s |
| `activation`, `equip`  | ✅     | ✅      | ✅        | 30–60s   |
| `book_read`, `container_changed` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅      | 60s      |
| `spell_cast`           | ✅     | ✅      | ✅        | 60–90s   |
| `dialogue_*`, `scene_*`| ✅     | ✅      | ❌        | 0        |
| `direct_narration`, `continue_narration` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌    | 0        |
| `custom`, `gamemaster_dialogue`, `player_thoughts` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 0    |

## 🚀 Usage Strategy Summary

### ✅ For Immersive Memory and Dialogue
- Set `Persistent = true` for all important events.
- Adjust `Event History Count` (50–100) for context depth.

### ✅ For NPC Interactivity
- Enable `Allow NPC Reaction` for immersive actions (combat, lockpicking, spell casting).
- Use custom cooldowns to avoid spammy chatter.

### ✅ For Performance Balance
- Use a `Preload Count` of 1000–3000 for good memory retention without overloading startup.
- Avoid enabling reactions on every event — pick impactful ones.
