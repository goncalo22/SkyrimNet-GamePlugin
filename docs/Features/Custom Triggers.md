#  Schema-Aware Trigger System

The Schema-Aware Trigger System in SkyrimNet allows you to define custom reactions to in-game events. This system makes NPCs, the player character, and the world itself more dynamic, offering immersive responses that feel tailored to what's happening in real time.

Triggers are event-driven rules that check for specific gameplay conditions, such as casting a spell or using an item. When conditions are met, a templated response is generated â€” from a whispered thought to a loud reaction from nearby NPCs.

---

## How Triggers Work

Each trigger consists of:

- **Event Type**: The in-game action that activates the trigger (e.g., `spell_cast`)
- **Conditions**: Fields like spell name, editor ID, or actor type that filter the trigger
- **Response Content**: A written message, using variables and templates
- **Response Type**: Defines how the line is delivered (thought, speech, narration)
- **Audience**: Who hears or sees the response (player, NPCs, etc.)
- **Optional Metadata**: Priority, probability, and cooldown timers

Triggers can be created manually or automatically based on spell/item customizations.

## ðŸŽ­ Response Types

| Type             | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Player Dialogue** | Spoken aloud by the player character              |
| **Player Thought**   | Silent internal monologue (immersive introspection) |
| **Direct Narration** | Descriptive text, often from an NPC or narrator  |

Each response style sets a different narrative tone and use case.

## ðŸ‘¥ Audience Options

You can target who receives the trigger response:

| Audience     | Description                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `player`     | Only the player sees/hears the response                        |
| `originator` | The actor who caused the event (e.g. spell caster)             |
| `target`     | The actor the event is aimed at (e.g. spell recipient)         |
| `nearby`     | All nearby actors (within a set distance)                      |
| `npcs`       | All nearby NPCs (excludes the player)                          |
| `everyone`   | Player and all nearby NPCs                                     |

This allows you to control perspective and immersion for every response.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conditions and Events

Each trigger uses **schema-aware conditions** tailored to its event type. For example, a `spell_cast` event includes:

- `spell`: The display name of the spell (e.g., *Ironflesh*)
- `spell_editor_id`: The internal ID of the spell
- `actor`: The caster of the spell

These fields can be matched using operators like `equals`, `contains`, or `starts_with`.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Response Templating

Response text is written using a flexible template language with variable support. You can insert values dynamically:

```handlebars
{{ actor.name }} begins to glow with magical energy.
I cast {{ event_json.spell }} and feel my skin tingle.
```

Templates allow you to reuse trigger logic across characters and situations without hardcoding dialogue.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example: Ironflesh Spell Reaction

**Trigger Name**: Ironflesh Trigger  
**Event**: `spell_cast`  
**Conditions**:
- `spell equals Ironflesh`
- `spell_editor_id equals Ironflesh`

**Response Type**: Player Thought  
**Audience**: Player  
**Cooldown**: 30 seconds  

**Response**:  
`I feel my skin tingle as it hardens while I cast {{ event_json.spell }}.`

---

## ðŸ”§ Managing Triggers

Triggers are created and edited via the **Trigger Management UI**. Each trigger supports:

- Setting **priority** (used when multiple triggers match)
- Configuring **chance** (e.g., 100% reliable or random 25% chance)
- Defining **cooldown** to prevent repeated responses
- Live **enabling/disabling** without restarting the game

You can also **search, filter**, and **reload** triggers instantly. The UI is schema-driven and adapts to the selected event type for easier configuration.

---

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Other Systems

Triggers integrate seamlessly with:

- **Item and Spell Customizations**: Auto-generating responses based on renamed spells or items
- **Memory and Emotion Systems**: Feeding into emotional state and memory entries
- **NPC Dialogue and Ambient Behavior**: Creating realistic chatter or commentary in response to events

This makes the trigger system a **bridge between world simulation and narrative design** â€” powerful for both modders and storytellers.
