## 🗣️ Piper TTS in SkyrimNet

**Piper TTS** is a fast,very performance friendly text-to-speech engine that gives Skyrim NPCs the ability to *actually talk*. Instead of just reading subtitles, players now **hear characters speak dynamically generated lines** — whether it's a guard asking a question, a merchant making a comment, or a follower reacting emotionally. Despite being the baseline TTS for Skyrimnet, Piper really enables anyone to experience real-time, voice acting with models sounding just like the original character. Its resource cost vs quality ratio is the best. Better options, like XTTs and Zonos come with much higher requeriments than Piper, though we encourage you to use them, if want the very best experience.

## 💡 What Piper Does

At its core, **Piper takes plain text and turns it into lifelike speech**.  
For example:

> **Input:** `"Be careful out there, traveler."`  
> **Output:** *Raw audio data of a human voice saying that line*

SkyrimNet uses this to voice any sentence an NPC says — even if that sentence was generated by an LLM on the fly.  
That means no more canned voice lines: the dialogue can now adapt to your choices, history, or even current events in the world.

## 🧠 How It Works Inside SkyrimNet

Piper is now **fully integrated and runs in-process inside SkyrimNet**. That means:

- ❌ No external Python servers or subprocesses  
- ✅ Runs natively inside the Skyrim DLL  
- ⚡ Ultra-fast performance, near-instant voice playback  
- 🔁 Supports real-time TTS during dialogue scenes

When SkyrimNet generates a line for an NPC — like:

> `"The storm’s coming. Better stay inside, friend."`

—it passes the text directly to Piper, which:

1. Synthesizes the speech in memory  
2. Returns raw audio data (typically **16-bit mono PCM**)  
3. SkyrimNet plays that audio immediately through the game's sound engine

Because it all happens **inside the same process**, it's lightning fast and stable — there's **no lag or voice mismatch**.

## 🧬 Dynamic and Immersive Dialogue

Unlike pre-recorded voice acting, Piper allows **completely dynamic lines** based on:

- The player’s actions and choices  
- NPC memory and mood *(handled by SkyrimNet)*  
- LLM-generated sentences on the fly  
- Roleplay scenarios *(e.g. seduction, warnings, taunts)*

So a bandit doesn’t just grunt the same line every time — they might **react to what you just said, and actually speak it out loud**.

## 🎭 Voices and Variety

Piper supports **many voice models** — male, female, accents, etc. In SkyrimNet:

- Each NPC can have a **different Piper voice**
- Voices can be tied to **race, gender, or personality**
- You can **swap voices at runtime** or customize them per mod

It’s like having a **fully voiced cast — but procedurally generated**.

## 🛠️ Why This Matters

Before Piper, modded dialogue was silent or used clunky, repetitive voice packs. Now, with **SkyrimNet + Piper**:

- NPCs **speak their thoughts dynamically**
- Conversations feel **alive and responsive**
- There's **no need to pre-record anything** — voices are generated in real time
- It opens the door for **AI-driven storytelling, romance, deception, persuasion**, and more

## TL;DR

**Piper TTS is the voice of SkyrimNet** — a real-time,immersive, in-process speech system that lets your modded Skyrim world *talk back*.  
It's fast, integrated directly into the engine, and supports any line an NPC might say, **no matter how unexpected**.
