### üó£Ô∏è What is Text-to-Speech (TTS)?
Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken voice. It allows computers to "speak" words out loud using synthetic or recorded voices. In the context of SkyrimNet, TTS is used to give NPCs the ability to talk dynamically ‚Äî not just with pre-recorded lines, but with sentences generated on the fly by the AI.

### üîß How It Works
TTS works in two steps: first, the system breaks down the written sentence into sounds (called phonemes), and then it uses a voice model to produce speech audio from those sounds. SkyrimNet uses modern neural TTS systems (like XTTS or Zonos) to make the voices sound natural and emotional ‚Äî as if a real person were speaking. These voices can be customized to sound robotic, dramatic, calm, or even imitate characters.

### üéÆ Why It Matters in SkyrimNet
With TTS, SkyrimNet can give life to AI-powered NPCs who speak new, personalized lines every time they interact with you. This means conversations are no longer limited to pre-written dialogue. NPCs can comment on your actions, remember past events, or express emotion ‚Äî all in their own voice, without requiring voice actors or modding tools like Creation Kit.

# üîä SkyrimNet TTS Engine Comparison

SkyrimNet supports multiple TTS backends ‚Äî each with unique strengths in quality, speed, and customization. Here's a side-by-side comparison of **Zonos**, **XTTS**, and **Piper**, so users can choose the best engine for their systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Choosing the Right Engine

| Scenario                                | Recommended Engine |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Voiced main quest with drama/emotion   | üéôÔ∏è **Zonos**       |
| Companion with a personalized voice    | üó£Ô∏è **XTTS**        |
| Fast ambient barks / guards / vendors  | ‚ö° **Piper**        |
| Fully dynamic AI-driven conversations  | üó£Ô∏è **XTTS**        |
| Low-end PC /  reduced available vram   | ‚ö° **Piper**        |

## TL;DR

- **Zonos** = *Premium, cinematic, cloned voices with deep expression*
- **XTTS** = *Default engine with cloning and great all-around quality*
- **Piper** = *Fastest engine, perfect for lightweight real-time voice playback*

All three engines can eventually be mixed and matched per actor or event within SkyrimNet for optimal performance and immersion. (note: not currently as of beta4)
