In order to improve the quality of LLM roleplay, I have done a one-time backwards incompatible restructuring of our system prompt and character bio. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery mod-added addition to the bio, or system head should number itself accordingly so that the file ends up in the appropriate place in the prompt for consistency. For example, ### Worn Equipment is now nested under ## Appearance & Physical State. I\'ve updated @wind and @Lazy Palm \'s mods to follow this convention, though all mod authors are likely to need to rename their files to account for this if they have additions to the character bio or system head sections, in order to ensure that their information is placed at the right spot. Check out the character_bio and system_head folders to reference the new structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will result in stronger and more consistent LLM responses, particularly from non-premium models (Though Sonnet and others benefit as well), and provides a solid base for us to build upon moving forward.  Almost every prompt has been touched in the character_bio and system_head submodules\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely open to suggestions and feedback on the new system prompt structure. Let me know what folks think.\\r\\n\\r\\n ### Overhauled UUID algorithm.    @Min\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several sources of drift with the old algorithm that could cause duplicate and/or drifting uuid\'s.,\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve written a diagnostic feature to detect this problem / migrate the entire database to the new uuid algorithm so that people don\'t lose events/memories (Like many of you, I also don\'t like restarting constantly if I can help it  ).,\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should correct cases where actors lost access to their memories and past events. There were a few reasons why this could happen, including adding/removing mods, changing load order, and other factors.,\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still a remaining source of drift for non-generic actors; Their ref id mutates regularly throughout normal play. I haven\'t addressed this just yet entirely, and am not sure if I need to or not as of yet. If I do need to address this, you\'ll be able to use this same tool to migrate to whatever I end up changing without losing data/progress.,\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider backing up your database before proceeding if you want to be able to revert back to rc6. The database can be found in skse/plugins/SkyrimNet/data/,\\r\\nTo migrate your database to the new schemas, first:,\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Visit the debug page at http://localhost:8080/debug \\r\\n2) Click the Execute Migration button under the Full UUID Migration section. Feel free to dry run it first with the provided interface. You must wait for this to complete before continuing to play the game.\\r\\n3) Save, reload, and then Execute Migration once more. Wait for this to complete.\\r\\n4) Save the game and continue playing.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: Diaries @Min\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded UI and experience around generating, viewing, and managing Diary Entries. Diary entries are currently triggered manually, just like dynamic bio updates,\\r\\n\\r\\nDiary entries are generated based upon recent memories, and recent events.,\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded new model type for this, so that you can use a separate model for diaries. Note: The default for this is Sonnet. If you\'re cost-adverse, I\'d suggest changing this to qwen or deepseek r1.,\\r\\n\\r\\nDiaries contain their own event type with a proper schema; You can create triggers/etc off of them like anything else. This event is persistent, and exposed only to the actor that made the diary.,\\r\\n\\r\\nDiary entries create an entry into the memory database with embeddings, so that they can be recalled by the actor later like any other memory.,\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Diary specific configuration: Check out the available options.,\\r\\n\\r\\nI tested this feature a fair bit, but there may be some rough edges: Send any feedback you may have around this! New diaries for actors that did not previously have one can (currently) only be generated from the Character page or the dashboard.,\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: Open Mic input mode @Daikichi\\r\\nAdds a toggle hotkey (default unset) to use voice activated input as an alternative to push-to-talk.,\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso changed the default Silence Duration in STTConfig from 500ms to 1000ms (the period of silence required after you speak for the speech to be finalized).,\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded Open Mic VRIK functions as well.,\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: Allow TTS Engine and TTS Language Overrides @Daikichi,\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can set specific npcs or groups to use one tts service while everyone else uses the global TTS,\\r\\n\\r\\nOverrides for the narrator / player thoughts can be done in the VirtualEntities config,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: ElevenLabs support @Daikichi\\r\\n\\r\\nMeant to be used in combination with the per-npc TTS override to give specific NPCs a very high quality (but expensive) TTS.,\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: Silent Dialogue TTS @Daikichi\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds a feature to voice silent NPC lines with TTS (from mods with no voice acting).,\\r\\n\\r\\nTo enable this feature, download Dragonborn Voice Over but disable or delete its DBVO.esp file (no voice pack is needed).,\\r\\n\\r\\nLip sync/subtitles and the spoken dialogue may not match up perfectly, though we make our best effort.,\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded a config option to aggressively sync displayed subtitles with the TTS audio. Disabled by default due to some potential UX friction. @Daikichi,\\r\\n\\r\\n### Make LLM parameters optional (Gemini Support) @Daikichi\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting LLM generation parameters such as top_p to blank now removes them from the request,\\r\\nThis effectively adds support for Gemini,\\r\\n\\r\\n### Add support for structured outputs @Daikichi\\r\\n\\r\\nNew flag in OpenRouter Config to enforce JSON output from LLMs (only affects memory generation),\\r\\nUseful for local model setups (LM Studio),\\r\\nLimited support via OpenRouter (only some providers),\\r\\n\\r\\n### Prompt Improvements @Min\\r\\nOverhauled Dynamic Bio Update prompt to enforce pruning, and generally avoid wild bio swings. Includes last diary entry.,\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded length guidelines to book reading events.,\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded awareness of summoned / reanimated / knocked down / etc states from new decorators.,\\r\\n\\r\\nTweaked memory generation to add mild length guidelines.,\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall presentation changes to various prompts.,\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Decorators @Min\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded has_perk decorator `{% if has_perk(player.UUID, \\\\\\"AdvancedSmithing\\\\\\") %}You have advanced smithing!{% endif %},`\\r\\nAdded get_all_perks decorator \\r\\n```\\r\\nmetadata.returnInfo.description = \\"Array of objects with \'editorID\' and \'rank\' properties for each perk\\"; \\r\\n metadata.returnInfo.exampleValue = nlohmann::json::array({\\r\\n      {{\\"editorID\\", \\"AdvancedSmithing\\"}, {\\"rank\\", 1}},\\r\\n      {{\\"editorID\\", \\"Locksmith\\"}, {\\"rank\\", 2}} });\\r\\n```\\r\\nAdded get_relationship_rank decorator `{% if get_relationship_rank(player.UUID, npc.UUID) >= 3 %}You are a good friend of John Doe!{% endif %}`\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded is_in_combat decorator `{% if is_in_combat(player.UUID) %}You are in combat!{% endif %}`\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded is_capable_of_speech decorator `{% if is_capable_of_speech(player.UUID) %}This actor is capable of intelligent speech!{% endif %}`\\r\\n\\r\\n`has_weapon_drawn` - Checks if an actor has their weapons drawn.,\\r\\n`is_sprinting` - True if an actor is sprinting.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_walking` - True if an actor is walking.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_sneaking` - True if an actor is sneaking.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_swimming` - True if an actor is swimming.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_unconscious` - True if an actor is unconscious.,\\r\\n\\r\\nIncorporated all of these into a new physical activity prompt, and updated the equipment prompt: https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/commit/d22f4c2d5c61dd328b5982da8ab483bb217dcb6f,\\r\\n\\r\\n`get_latest_diary_entry` - Returns latest diary entry for an actor.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`get_diary_entries` - Returns the last N diary entries for an actor.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`get_spell_list` - Returns an object containing all spells known by an actor.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_summoned` - Returns true if actor is summoned.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_reanimated` - Returns true if actor is reanimated.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_knocked_down` - Returns true if actor is in essential down or bleedout.,\\r\\n\\r\\n`is_hostile_to_actor` decorator for checking if one actor is hostile to another. @Min,\\r\\n\\r\\n### API Improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nSending an empty DirectNarration will trigger a response without leaving anything in the context @Min\\r\\nParseString Papyrus function now converts variable names to lowercase @Min\\r\\nAdded new api GetTimeSinceLastAudioEnded() to allow modders to tell how long there has been silence for, for better pacing @Min\\r\\nAdded new api GenerateDiaryEntry(actor) - Triggers a diary entry for a given actor.,\\r\\nAdded new api UnregisterAction @Min,\\r\\nAdded paralysis and brainCondition actor values to decnpc(npc.UUID) @Min"},{"id":"/2025/10/12/beta6-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/10/12/beta6-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/goncalo22/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/edit/main/blog/blog/2025-10-12-beta6-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-12-beta6-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta6  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta6","date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta6","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta-6"}],"readingTime":5.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta6  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta6","tags":["release","beta6"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta7  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/11/02/beta7-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta5  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/08/04/beta5-release"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89  SkyrimNet Beta 6 Latest\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n# SkyrimNet Beta6 \u2014 Full Changelog\\r\\n\\r\\n### Summary\\r\\nThis release is mostly focused on bugfixes, quality of life improvements, and several cool new features such as model rotation, automatic voiced player vanilla dialogue through DBVO, XTTS voice cloning, and a new whisper mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n### XTTS Voice cloning @Elbios \\r\\n\\r\\nNow XTTS has automatic voice cloning just like Zonos or our other Gradios TTS with the same mechanism.\\r\\nWhen running XTTS locally, requires updated xtts-api-server available here\\r\\nWhen using vast AI, no action is needed\\r\\nComes with an option to turn automatic voice cloning off.\\r\\nModel Rotation @mikastamm\\r\\nNew model rotation feature, that changes the dialogue model after each generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the model name field, you can now have multiple models, seperated by commas. After each converation turn, it will switch models to the next in the list. This only works for the \u2018Default\u2019 (Conversation) model type\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can make the NPCs responses more varied or keep weaker models on-track by having a smarter model respond every once in a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry mixing in a stronger model once in a while to keep the conversation interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example:**\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\"openrouter/sonoma-dusk-alpha, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Api Extensions @mikastamm @MinLL\\r\\nThe following papyrus functions were added to the api:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n; Change values of SkyrimNets config\\r\\n; - name: The name of the configuration section to modify (eg. game, Memory)\\r\\n; - jsonPatch: The partial json, containg only the values to apply to the config.

Example: is_player(npc.UUID). This will return true if the actor is the player. @MinLL\\r\\n\\r\\n### Player-Voiced Vanilla Dialogue (Dragonborn Voice Over Integration) @Dekana\\r\\n\\r\\nSkyrimNet now supports voicing the player\'s vanilla dialogue lines with TTS.\\r\\nTo enable this feature, download Dragonborn Voice Over but disable or delete its DBVO.esp file (no voice pack is needed).\\r\\nSkyrimNet will capture the dialogue event from DBVO and send it to TTS, rather than using a static voice pack.\\r\\nYou can adjust the delay before an NPC responds to your dialogue selection in Advanced Configuration -> game -> Player-Voiced Vanilla Dialogue (DBVO).\\r\\nIf the DBVO.esp file is active, then this feature will be disabled.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: Whisper Mode @MinLL\\r\\n\\r\\n- Players can now toggle between two configureable \\"max interaction ranges\\". \\r\\nThis setting limits the range at which actors will perceive events. You can configure the radius via the game config.\\r\\nUseful if you want to have a more private conversation without nosy folks interrupting.\\r\\nMore coming in this particular area soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tweaks @MinLL\\r\\n\\r\\n- Actor / Memory Whitelists will now bypass \\"Is capable of speech\\" filter. @MinLL\\r\\n- Actor skills are now exposed in the return value from decnpc in templates. Ex. decnpc(npc.UUID).onehanded @MinLL\\r\\n- Added memory generation filter, allowing you to control which actor\'s generate memories.\\r\\n- Newly registered event schemas are now enabled by default @MinLL\\r\\n- Added new SkyrimNet factions to actor filter by default. No flow is published at present for easily adding/removing things to these outside of the console, but this will let us later set up a flow to allow users to - easily allowlist/denylist NPC\'s. @vrelk\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bugfixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Sanitized TTS input to avoid weird audio glitches with unicode characters and symbols @MinLL\\r\\n- Added output sanitization to handle some Chinese models sending excessive newlines in their output. @MinLL\\r\\n- Fixed utf8 sanitization issue with template input. @MinLL\\r\\n- Fixed triggers not working for short lived events registered from Papyrus @MinLL\\r\\n- Add missing npc from 3DNPC mod @mikastamm\\r\\n- Adds prompt for the follower Koemia @mikastamm\\r\\n- Fix typo in action selection prompt @Dekana\\r\\n- Fix misnamed prompt file for the character Silvia @Dekana\\r\\n- Add instructions in the github readme and the TTS test page to install piper models @Dekana\\r\\n- Change cuda link to archived 12.9 in the github readme @Dekana\\r\\n- Remove \\"emotions\\" key from zonos default settings so that SkyrimNet\'s custom mood values will be used @Dekana\\r\\n- Fix error spam for disembodied speakers (eg. Augur of Dunlain and Hermeus Mora) @Dekana\\r\\n- Better Error message if a user has not downloaded the Piper models and tries to run it @Dekana\\r\\n- Fix inability to add new event entries to the player response configuration @Dekana\\r\\n- Fix STT sometimes rejecting short voice inputs @mikastamm\\r\\n- Added an extra option Max Interaction Distance : Governs at which distance from the player the audio cuts out.

Groups are sets of config overrides that you can apply to multiple actors (Ex, \\"High quality\\" for followers, etc) to avoid having to maintain the same settings in more than one place. I\'ll likely expand the \\"group\\" feature to allow automatic application to factions, races, genders, etc at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The config system itself supports overriding any config value from any config file anywhere (Assuming that the config value makes sense within a per-actor context), but I need to explicitly enable support the field being overridable like this. Let me know what areas you folks think would benefit the most from being wired up. In the initial implementation, I support overriding the voice id, and openrouter settings, as those seem to be the two highest ROI. It\'s relatively easy to add more from here, though supporting multiple different TTS engines simultaneously is not currently possible. I\'ll fix this at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: \\r\\nAdded a dictionary for changing the pronunciation of words pronounced by the TTS (Khajiit -> Kajeet, etc). If you notice any words that are consistently being misread by TTS and you think it should be part of the default dictionary, let us know in #beta-feedback!\\r\\n\\r\\n - Elbios\' vastAI images are the new default images for smart create. These images are improvements over the existing ones which feature the ability to run both Whisper and (XTTS or Zonos) out of the same image.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added support for sending keep-alive messages to prevent the new images from tearing themselves down. Elbios\' images are configured to automatically shut down after one hour of inactivity to prevent users from forgetting about them and running up a bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Expanded smart create logic for VastAI - It will now create N instances (default: 5), and then tear down all but the first one to successfully come up and be ready to serve traffic. This should result in much more reliable instance creation, and result in the user ending up with better/faster images more often than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added new presets for VastAI creation - Can now switch between XTTS and Zonos image presets in the VastAI page.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added button for quick-setting STT (External Whisper) to the VastAI instance.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Fixed prompt issue causing actors to fixate on their weapon (Hand goes to dagger narrate spam).\\r\\n\\r\\n - Line of Sight requirement for events is now ignored during combat.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Assorted prompt tweaks and fixes."},{"id":"/2025/07/19/beta3-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/19/beta3-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/goncalo22/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/edit/main/blog/blog/2025-07-19-beta3-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-19-beta3-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta3","date":"2025-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta3","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta-3"}],"readingTime":1.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta3","tags":["release","beta3"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta4  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/21/beta4-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025-07-13-beta2-release"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89  SkyrimNet Beta 3 Latest\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n# \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f SkyrimNet Beta 3 Changelog\\r\\n\\r\\n[\ud83d\udce5 Download Beta 3 on GitHub](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases/tag/Beta3)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udc1b Important Bug Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Locale Support:**  \\r\\n  The mod now correctly handles locales where commas are used instead of periods for decimal values (e.g. France, Germany).  \\r\\n  > \u26a0\ufe0f **Recommendation:** If you\'re using one of these locales, delete all existing configs.

However, **this update will overwrite** it once to enable new format and caching support.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **VRIK Action hotkey support** added.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Memory Generation Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improved memory accuracy for **location and people** involved.\\r\\n- Avoids generating memories for events within the **last 8 minutes**.\\r\\n- New default for max memories per retrieval: **5**.\\r\\n- Memory generation algorithm is now **time-segmented**:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Segmentation Rules:\\r\\n1. Segment must last at least **10 game minutes** (`min_segment_duration`)\\r\\n2. Segment max is **12 game hours** (`max_segment_duration`)\\r\\n3. Max **200 events** per memory\\r\\n4. Minimum **5 events**\\r\\n5. Time gap of over 60 minutes triggers a boundary\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Examples:\\r\\n- **Conversation \u2192 Travel \u2192 Combat**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> In testing:  \\r\\n> **518 \u2192 162** memories  \\r\\n> Nearly same fidelity, significantly more cohesive.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### To regenerate old memories:\\r\\n1. Set `\\"Event Preload Count\\"` to `5000` in config\\r\\n2. Delete all memories via in-game UI\\r\\n3. Restart game\\r\\n4. Click \\"Generate\\" in memory tab (up to 100 each batch)\\r\\n5. Repeat as needed or increase batch size in config\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udee0 Enhancements\\r\\n\\r\\n- Actors now react to **health/magicka/stamina** in combat\\r\\n- Increased default **event cooldowns**\\r\\n- Added **Quick Settings menu** to Easy Setup page\\r\\n- Fixed **Papyrus decorators** performance \u2014 modders can now safely publish plugins\\r\\n- **Dynamic Narration API** now renders template variables\\r\\n- Exposed **profile generation prompt**\\r\\n- Improved **location & time awareness**\\r\\n- Smarter **target gender/race** awareness\\r\\n- Removed `[ Background ]` markers from LLM dialogue\\r\\n- **Papyrus decorators** are now:\\r\\n- Evaluated ahead-of-time\\r\\n- Cached\\r\\n- Only executed when needed\\r\\n- Speech pacing tweaks: **less spammy dialogue**\\r\\n- Events now sorted by **local time**, not game time\\r\\n- SKSE version downgraded to **2.0.1.104** (supports older game versions)\\r\\n- Faction filter now uses **Editor ID**\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udc1e Bug Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Actors stop talking on **death**\\r\\n- Speech queues flushed on **save reload**\\r\\n- Fixed errors in **Dynamic Bio**\\r\\n- Stopped false hit events from triggering LLM dialogue\\r\\n- Critical fix: prevent **Papyrus decorators** from executing while VM is paused\\r\\n- Fixed character save failures in editor\\r\\n- Fixed NPCs **responding to themselves**\\r\\n- Referrer now points to correct GitHub repo\\r\\n- Fixed template render errors for `responseTarget`\\r\\n- Case sensitivity issue in decorators\' JSON booleans resolved\\r\\n- **Global event cooldown** now functions correctly\\r\\n- Fixed decimal input issue for **some locales**\\r\\n- Exposed **event cache count** for game load\\r\\n- Silenced harmless console errors\\r\\n- Resolved memory generation template errors\\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"/2025/07/06/beta-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/06/beta-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/goncalo22/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/edit/main/blog/blog/2025-07-06-beta-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-06-beta-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta","date":"2025-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta"}],"readingTime":1.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta","tags":["release","beta"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025-07-13-beta2-release"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce the **beta release** of **SkyrimNet** \u2013 the most advanced AI platform for gaming that transforms every NPC into a living, breathing character!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What Makes SkyrimNet Revolutionary?\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other AI projects that require complex external servers or WSL installations, **SkyrimNet runs entirely as a single game DLL**, offering:\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u26a1 **Faster response times** and **lower system load**\\r\\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Streamlined setup** with no server configuration required\\r\\n- \ud83e\udde0 **Real-time responsiveness** with direct memory access\\r\\n- \ud83d\udc65 **3,000+ unique personalities** for all vanilla NPCs\\r\\n- \ud83e\uddfe **Advanced memory system** \u2013 NPCs remember past conversations and form relationships\\r\\n- \ud83d\udc42 **Smart awareness** \u2013 NPCs only know what they can realistically see or hear\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Game-Changing Features\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Dynamic AI Interactions**  \\r\\n  NPCs react to in-game events and initiate conversations based on goals, not scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Multi-Modal Communication**  \\r\\n  Includes voice recognition, text input, and synchronized facial animations.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Professional Web Interface**  \\r\\n  Monitor characters live, manage memory, configure behavior, and access cloud services.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Modder-Friendly Design**  \\r\\n  Papyrus API fully supports traditional Skyrim modding workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **One-Click Cloud Setup**  \\r\\n  Automatically provisions **VastAI** for high-quality **XTTS voice generation**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\uddf0 Easy Installation\\r\\n\\r\\n1.
