Groups are sets of config overrides that you can apply to multiple actors (Ex, \\"High quality\\" for followers, etc) to avoid having to maintain the same settings in more than one place. I\'ll likely expand the \\"group\\" feature to allow automatic application to factions, races, genders, etc at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The config system itself supports overriding any config value from any config file anywhere (Assuming that the config value makes sense within a per-actor context), but I need to explicitly enable support the field being overridable like this. Let me know what areas you folks think would benefit the most from being wired up. In the initial implementation, I support overriding the voice id, and openrouter settings, as those seem to be the two highest ROI. It\'s relatively easy to add more from here, though supporting multiple different TTS engines simultaneously is not currently possible. I\'ll fix this at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: \\r\\nAdded a dictionary for changing the pronunciation of words pronounced by the TTS (Khajiit -> Kajeet, etc). If you notice any words that are consistently being misread by TTS and you think it should be part of the default dictionary, let us know in #beta-feedback!\\r\\n\\r\\n - Elbios\' vastAI images are the new default images for smart create. These images are improvements over the existing ones which feature the ability to run both Whisper and (XTTS or Zonos) out of the same image.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added support for sending keep-alive messages to prevent the new images from tearing themselves down. Elbios\' images are configured to automatically shut down after one hour of inactivity to prevent users from forgetting about them and running up a bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Expanded smart create logic for VastAI - It will now create N instances (default: 5), and then tear down all but the first one to successfully come up and be ready to serve traffic. This should result in much more reliable instance creation, and result in the user ending up with better/faster images more often than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added new presets for VastAI creation - Can now switch between XTTS and Zonos image presets in the VastAI page.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added button for quick-setting STT (External Whisper) to the VastAI instance.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Fixed prompt issue causing actors to fixate on their weapon (Hand goes to dagger narrate spam).\\r\\n\\r\\n - Line of Sight requirement for events is now ignored during combat.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Assorted prompt tweaks and fixes."},{"id":"/2025/07/19/beta3-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/19/beta3-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-19-beta3-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-19-beta3-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta3","date":"2025-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta3","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta-3"}],"readingTime":2.19,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta3","tags":["release","beta3"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta4  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/21/beta4-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/13/beta2-release"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89  SkyrimNet Beta 3 Latest\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant bug fix: Mod now properly handles locales that use commas in place of periods for decimals. If you are in one of these locales (ex France, Germany, etc), highly recommend that you delete all configs, as a number of configurations will have bad values for you. This is what was causing some users to have issues such as facial animations not working.,\\r\\nImportant optimization: Considerably reduced latency before response generation begins for dialogue. I implemented a significant performance improvement to how we retrieve events, in order to resolve an issue that was causing delays for dialogue generation when large numbers of events were present. The mod is even faster now. ,\\r\\nIn my local tests, I saw between a 500-1000ms reduction in response time from NPC\'s with this change. For the other nerds here, event processing and retrieval is now O(1) complexity instead of O(n).\\r\\nEnhancement: Several internal systems have been refactored to expand test coverage, and improve our ability to detect and prevent bugs.,\\r\\nBug Fix: There is now a short pause inbetween segments of conversations to avoid piper rapid-fire responding.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Added has_magic_effect and has_spell decorators (Still need more testing, not used by any of my templates just yet). I intend to use this for a lot of things, such as influencing RP when calm / fury spells are present, etc. This will make mod integrations much easier.,\\r\\nEnhancement: The context history now contains all events that are marked as persistent, aside from a handful of types that I have explicitly excluded.,\\r\\nEnhancement: The isTimePaused variable is now present in both builds, allowing mod authors to prevent their papyrus decorators from firing while the VM is paused,\\r\\nBug Fix: The Zonos tests are now fixed in the UI.,\\r\\nBug Fix: The default narrator now has the correct serana voice type.,\\r\\nBug Fix: Zonos now properly supports virtual entities,\\r\\nEnhancement: Lowered the default \\"proximity to ignore LoS\\" to 350 (From 500). This radius controls the distance at which NPC\'s ignore line of sight requirements. The old setting was a bit too permissive. Update your game config to the new value.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Assorted prompt tweaks,\\r\\nEnhancement: Added C++ API for more powerful mod integrations. Mod authors can now integrate with Skyrim from other SKSE plugins. Documentation for this to be added shortly.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Zonos caching improvements,\\r\\nBug Fix: Event registration API now handles unknown event types properly.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Tweaked dynamic bio update to work with more LLM\'s, and be less aggressive at pruning old content.,\\r\\nBug Fix: Other small bug fixes.,\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases/tag/Beta3"},{"id":"/2025/07/13/beta2-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/13/beta2-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-13-beta2-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-13-beta2-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta2","date":"2025-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta2","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta-2"}],"readingTime":2.96,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta2","tags":["release","beta2"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/19/beta3-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/06/beta-release"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89  SkyrimNet Beta 3 Latest\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Download the new release here:**  \\r\\n> [https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases/tag/Beta2](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases/tag/Beta2)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 Installation Instructions\\r\\n\\r\\nInstall like any other mod through your mod manager, replacing the existing SkyrimNet files.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Important notes when upgrading:\\r\\n1. The default values for many configurations have changed. We **recommend deleting** the folder:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will restore all settings to default.\\r\\n2. New users must still install the models during installation, same as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \u2728 New Features\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Item customization interface**  \\r\\nUsers can now customize the display of worn equipment and weapons, as well as enable or disable their visibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **HTTP server address/port config** added.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Combat variant selection** in OpenRouter config is now used for dialogue in combat. This allows fast models like Sonnet to be used during combat while retaining slow, high-quality models otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Universal \\"max volume\\" setting**  \\r\\nApplies to both spatial and virtual entity (narrator/player) audio.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Memory generation** now uses its own OpenRouter config variant.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Sonnet caching support**  \\r\\n- Significantly reduces costs and response time.  \\r\\n- Cache TTL is 1 hour (only honored by Anthropic; others use 5 minutes).\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Dynamic cache-extension**  \\r\\nAllows the event history cache to span 3\xd7 longer than normal for better memory fidelity.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **\\"The Party\\" kill attribution toggle** added.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Characters no longer ship directly in the `prompts` folder. They are now **copied only if missing**, to preserve customizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Settings file also no longer ships in default location. However, **this update will overwrite** it once to enable new format and caching support.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **VRIK Action hotkey support** added.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Memory Generation Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improved memory accuracy for **location and people** involved.\\r\\n- Avoids generating memories for events within the **last 8 minutes**.\\r\\n- New default for max memories per retrieval: **5**.\\r\\n- Memory generation algorithm is now **time-segmented**:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Segmentation Rules:\\r\\n1. Segment must last at least **10 game minutes** (`min_segment_duration`)\\r\\n2. Segment max is **12 game hours** (`max_segment_duration`)\\r\\n3. Max **200 events** per memory\\r\\n4. Minimum **5 events**\\r\\n5. Time gap of over 60 minutes triggers a boundary\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Examples:\\r\\n- **Conversation \u2192 Travel \u2192 Combat**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> In testing:  \\r\\n> **518 \u2192 162** memories  \\r\\n> Nearly same fidelity, significantly more cohesive.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### To regenerate old memories:\\r\\n1. Set `\\"Event Preload Count\\"` to `5000` in config\\r\\n2. Delete all memories via in-game UI\\r\\n3. Restart game\\r\\n4. Click \\"Generate\\" in memory tab (up to 100 each batch)\\r\\n5. Repeat as needed or increase batch size in config\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udee0 Enhancements\\r\\n\\r\\n- Actors now react to **health/magicka/stamina** in combat\\r\\n- Increased default **event cooldowns**\\r\\n- Added **Quick Settings menu** to Easy Setup page\\r\\n- Fixed **Papyrus decorators** performance \u2014 modders can now safely publish plugins\\r\\n- **Dynamic Narration API** now renders template variables\\r\\n- Exposed **profile generation prompt**\\r\\n- Improved **location & time awareness**\\r\\n- Smarter **target gender/race** awareness\\r\\n- Removed `[ Background ]` markers from LLM dialogue\\r\\n- **Papyrus decorators** are now:\\r\\n- Evaluated ahead-of-time\\r\\n- Cached\\r\\n- Only executed when needed\\r\\n- Speech pacing tweaks: **less spammy dialogue**\\r\\n- Events now sorted by **local time**, not game time\\r\\n- SKSE version downgraded to **2.0.1.104** (supports older game versions)\\r\\n- Faction filter now uses **Editor ID**\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udc1e Bug Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Actors stop talking on **death**\\r\\n- Speech queues flushed on **save reload**\\r\\n- Fixed errors in **Dynamic Bio**\\r\\n- Stopped false hit events from triggering LLM dialogue\\r\\n- Critical fix: prevent **Papyrus decorators** from executing while VM is paused\\r\\n- Fixed character save failures in editor\\r\\n- Fixed NPCs **responding to themselves**\\r\\n- Referrer now points to correct GitHub repo\\r\\n- Fixed template render errors for `responseTarget`\\r\\n- Case sensitivity issue in decorators\' JSON booleans resolved\\r\\n- **Global event cooldown** now functions correctly\\r\\n- Fixed decimal input issue for **some locales**\\r\\n- Exposed **event cache count** for game load\\r\\n- Silenced harmless console errors\\r\\n- Resolved memory generation template errors\\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"/2025/07/06/beta-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/06/beta-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-06-beta-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-06-beta-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta","date":"2025-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta"}],"readingTime":1.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta","tags":["release","beta"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta2 Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/13/beta2-release"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce the **beta release** of **SkyrimNet** \u2013 the most advanced AI platform for gaming that transforms every NPC into a living, breathing character!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 What Makes SkyrimNet Revolutionary?\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike other AI projects that require complex external servers or WSL installations, **SkyrimNet runs entirely as a single game DLL**, offering:\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u26a1 **Faster response times** and **lower system load**\\r\\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Streamlined setup** with no server configuration required\\r\\n- \ud83e\udde0 **Real-time responsiveness** with direct memory access\\r\\n- \ud83d\udc65 **3,000+ unique personalities** for all vanilla NPCs\\r\\n- \ud83e\uddfe **Advanced memory system** \u2013 NPCs remember past conversations and form relationships\\r\\n- \ud83d\udc42 **Smart awareness** \u2013 NPCs only know what they can realistically see or hear\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Game-Changing Features\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Dynamic AI Interactions**  \\r\\n  NPCs react to in-game events and initiate conversations based on goals, not scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Multi-Modal Communication**  \\r\\n  Includes voice recognition, text input, and synchronized facial animations.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Professional Web Interface**  \\r\\n  Monitor characters live, manage memory, configure behavior, and access cloud services.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Modder-Friendly Design**  \\r\\n  Papyrus API fully supports traditional Skyrim modding workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **One-Click Cloud Setup**  \\r\\n  Automatically provisions **VastAI** for high-quality **XTTS voice generation**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\uddf0 Easy Installation\\r\\n\\r\\n1.
