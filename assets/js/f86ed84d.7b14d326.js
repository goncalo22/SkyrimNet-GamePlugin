If you are in one of these locales (ex France, Germany, etc), highly recommend that you delete all configs, as a number of configurations will have bad values for you. This is what was causing some users to have issues such as facial animations not working.,\\r\\nImportant optimization: Considerably reduced latency before response generation begins for dialogue. I implemented a significant performance improvement to how we retrieve events, in order to resolve an issue that was causing delays for dialogue generation when large numbers of events were present. The mod is even faster now. ,\\r\\nIn my local tests, I saw between a 500-1000ms reduction in response time from NPC\'s with this change. For the other nerds here, event processing and retrieval is now O(1) complexity instead of O(n).\\r\\nEnhancement: Several internal systems have been refactored to expand test coverage, and improve our ability to detect and prevent bugs.,\\r\\nBug Fix: There is now a short pause inbetween segments of conversations to avoid piper rapid-fire responding.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Added has_magic_effect and has_spell decorators (Still need more testing, not used by any of my templates just yet). I intend to use this for a lot of things, such as influencing RP when calm / fury spells are present, etc. This will make mod integrations much easier.,\\r\\nEnhancement: The context history now contains all events that are marked as persistent, aside from a handful of types that I have explicitly excluded.,\\r\\nEnhancement: The isTimePaused variable is now present in both builds, allowing mod authors to prevent their papyrus decorators from firing while the VM is paused,\\r\\nBug Fix: The Zonos tests are now fixed in the UI.,\\r\\nBug Fix: The default narrator now has the correct serana voice type.,\\r\\nBug Fix: Zonos now properly supports virtual entities,\\r\\nEnhancement: Lowered the default \\"proximity to ignore LoS\\" to 350 (From 500). This radius controls the distance at which NPC\'s ignore line of sight requirements. The old setting was a bit too permissive. Update your game config to the new value.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Assorted prompt tweaks,\\r\\nEnhancement: Added C++ API for more powerful mod integrations. Mod authors can now integrate with Skyrim from other SKSE plugins. Documentation for this to be added shortly.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Zonos caching improvements,\\r\\nBug Fix: Event registration API now handles unknown event types properly.,\\r\\nEnhancement: Tweaked dynamic bio update to work with more LLM\'s, and be less aggressive at pruning old content.,\\r\\nBug Fix: Other small bug fixes.,\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/releases/tag/Beta3"},{"id":"/2025/07/27/v1.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/2025/07/27/v1.0-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-27-v1.0-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-27-v1.0-release.md","title":"SkyrimNet Beta4  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta4","date":"2025-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"release","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/release"},{"inline":true,"label":"beta4","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/tags/beta-4"}],"readingTime":2.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta4  Released","description":"SkyrimNet Beta4","tags":["release","beta4"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SkyrimNet Beta3  Released","permalink":"/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/blog/beta3 release"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89  SkyrimNet Beta 4 Latest\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Major new feature: \\r\\n- Now supports per-actor customizations (And per-group). Groups are sets of config overrides that you can apply to multiple actors (Ex, \\"High quality\\" for followers, etc) to avoid having to maintain the same settings in more than one place. I\'ll likely expand the \\"group\\" feature to allow automatic application to factions, races, genders, etc at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The config system itself supports overriding any config value from any config file anywhere (Assuming that the config value makes sense within a per-actor context), but I need to explicitly enable support the field being overridable like this. Let me know what areas you folks think would benefit the most from being wired up. In the initial implementation, I support overriding the voice id, and openrouter settings, as those seem to be the two highest ROI. It\'s relatively easy to add more from here, though supporting multiple different TTS engines simultaneously is not currently possible. I\'ll fix this at a later point.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Feature: \\r\\nAdded a dictionary for changing the pronunciation of words pronounced by the TTS (Khajiit -> Kajeet, etc). If you notice any words that are consistently being misread by TTS and you think it should be part of the default dictionary, let us know in #beta-feedback!\\r\\n\\r\\n - Elbios\' vastAI images are the new default images for smart create. These images are improvements over the existing ones which feature the ability to run both Whisper and (XTTS or Zonos) out of the same image.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added support for sending keep-alive messages to prevent the new images from tearing themselves down. Elbios\' images are configured to automatically shut down after one hour of inactivity to prevent users from forgetting about them and running up a bill.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Expanded smart create logic for VastAI - It will now create N instances (default: 5), and then tear down all but the first one to successfully come up and be ready to serve traffic. This should result in much more reliable instance creation, and result in the user ending up with better/faster images more often than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added new presets for VastAI creation - Can now switch between XTTS and Zonos image presets in the VastAI page.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Added button for quick-setting STT (External Whisper) to the VastAI instance.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Fixed prompt issue causing actors to fixate on their weapon (Hand goes to dagger narrate spam).\\r\\n\\r\\n - Line of Sight requirement for events is now ignored during combat.\\r\\n\\r\\n - Assorted prompt tweaks and fixes."}]}}')}}]);
