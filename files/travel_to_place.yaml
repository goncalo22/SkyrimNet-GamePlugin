name: TravelToPlace
description: "Always use when {{ player.name }} says things to the target NPC like: 'meet me at <place>', 'lead the way to <place> (should run)', 'head to <place>', 'go on ahead to <place>', 'wait for me at <place>', 'go to <place> and I will catch up', 'let's meet at <place>'. DO NOT use if {{ player.name }} says 'follow me', 'come with me', 'let's go together' or anything similar — in those cases choose AccompanyTarget instead. Also pay attention to the context and don't use if inappropriate. If ambiguous, ask one brief clarification. Avoid triggering during combat or if you cannot act. Use the CANONICAL_PLACE values listed below exactly for asPlaceName. If the target NPC agrees to travel/meet, this is a strong indicator that this action SHOULD be chosen."
