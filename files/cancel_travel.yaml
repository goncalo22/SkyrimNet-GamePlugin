description: "Always use with prioritywhen {{ player.name }} says 'stop', 'stop running', 'wait', 'hold up', 'cancel that', 'new plan', or gives a different instruction that conflicts with ongoing travel (e.g., follow me, trade, fight, go somewhere else). Important: If the player constantly says stop or wait, this action SHOULD be chosen with highest priority!"
